## Abstract
In this paper, we study and model the relation between electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and predict the waveform of ECG using PPG measurement. As the first work to address this inverse problem, we propose and train a linear transform which maps the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of the PPG cycle to those of the corresponding ECG cycle. The resulting DCT coefficients of the ECG cycle are then inversely transformed to obtain the predicted ECG waveform. We evaluate our system on a benchmark dataset of subjects with a rich combination of age and weight. Experimental results show that our proposed prediction method can achieve high accuracy at 0.98 in averaged correlation.
