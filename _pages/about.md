Hello! This is Xin Tian's home on the web! I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park. I am advised by [prof. Min Wu](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~minwu/). My research interest is a synergy of signal processing, data analysis and machine learning, with applications in healthcare, wearable devices and more.
